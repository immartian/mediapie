MediaPie
========

Using a simple all-in-one device to access peer to peer audio/video/document center for home entertainment. 

The ideas is very simple, we need versatile media programs(including audio/video/pictures etc.), not from traditional ration/tv stations, but shared from our trusted social connections(family, friends, etc.). The MediaPie solution is trying to simplify everything without the pain of confirgurations, tuning or perplex steps of locating right content. 

The inital idea is to build and package everything with a Raspberry Pi board. However, the recipe and idea can be implement with any other programmable platform. I wish it can grow by everyone with his/her own needs.
