MediaPie
========

Using a simple all-in-one device to access peer to peer audio/video/document center for home entertainment. 

The ideas is very simple, we need versatile media programs(including audio/video/pictures etc.), not from traditional ration/tv stations, but shared from our trusted social connections(family, friends, etc.). The MediaPie solution is trying to simplify everything without the pain of confirgurations, tuning or perplex steps of locating right content. 

The inital idea is to build and package everything with a Raspberry Pi board. However, the recipe and idea can be implement with any other programmable platform. I wish it can grow by everyone with his/her own needs. 

Why Raspberry Pi? --- "With over 1,000,000 Raspberry Pi’s in the wild, it wouldn’t surprise me if there are some left unused, tucked away in their boxes, waiting for a killer app. I’m here to tell you that the app is here and you can set it up in about 20 minutes. There is no coding or no command line work involved; You don’t even need a keyboard. It’s likely the most simple thing you can do with your Pi besides removing it from the box. That app is Raspbmc, a port of the classic media center program XBMC, which transforms your Raspberry Pi into a full-on media player."--- http://blog.makezine.com/2013/03/11/raspberry-pi-media-center-rocks-my-world-part-1/
